# Android Privacy Risk Analyzer

**Static Code Inspection Toolkit for Detecting Privacy and Security Vulnerabilities in Android Applications**

---

## Overview

The **Android Privacy Risk Analyzer** is a static analysis toolkit designed to identify privacy and security vulnerabilities in Android APKs.  
It inspects manifests, permissions, and API calls to detect patterns associated with data exposure, insecure communication, and improper resource access.

This tool bridges **software engineering** and **cybersecurity auditing**, providing a reproducible and automated framework for privacy risk assessment.

### Suitable For
- Security engineers performing mobile application audits  
- Developers conducting pre-release vulnerability checks  
- Researchers studying privacy patterns in Android ecosystems

## Features

| Category | Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis** | **Static Analysis (SAST)** | Inspects manifests, permissions, and API calls for insecure configurations and data exposure risks. |
| **Risk Scoring** | **Automated Privacy Scoring** | Assigns each application a quantitative risk score based on detected vulnerabilities. |
| **Machine Learning** | **Unsupervised Pattern Clustering** | Uses clustering algorithms to group apps with similar risk characteristics. |
| **Reporting** | **Automated PDF Reports** | Generates comprehensive reports summarizing detected issues, severity, and recommendations. |

| **Scalability** | **Batch Analysis Support** | Enables scanning of multiple APKs for enterprise-scale assessment. |

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peaceolad/android-privacy-risk-analyzer.git
cd android-privacy-risk-analyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Analyze a Single APK

```bash
python analyze_apk.py samples/test_app.apk
```

**Output Example**

```
[INFO] Scanning APK...
[INFO] Extracted 11 permissions
[INFO] Detected 3 high-risk APIs (Network, Storage, Location)
[INFO] Privacy Risk Score: 78 (High Risk)
[INFO] Report saved: reports/test_app_report.pdf
```

### 2. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The dashboard visualizes:

* Application-level risk summaries
* Risk distribution by category
* Clustering analysis results
* Temporal trends of privacy exposure

---

## Sample Report Summary

**Application:** com.example.testapp
**Risk Level:** High
**Detected Issues:**

* Access to external storage without encryption
* Unrestricted network communication
* Background location tracking

**Recommendations:**

* Enforce HTTPS-only policies
* Use runtime permission requests
* Encrypt sensitive user data at rest and in transit

├── analyze_apk.py              # Core analysis pipeline
├── clustering.py               # ML clustering and pattern grouping
├── generate_report.py          # PDF report generator
├── dashboard.py                # Streamlit dashboard
├── utils/                      # Helper functions and parsers

├── reports/                    # Generated reports
└── requirements.txt            # Dependencies
```

---

## Example Workflow

1. Drop an APK file into the `samples/` directory
2. Run the analysis command
3. Review console output for summary
4. Open the generated PDF report
5. Optionally visualize all results in the Streamlit dashboard

This end-to-end pipeline allows developers and analysts to assess privacy risks efficiently in both single-app and batch-audit modes.
